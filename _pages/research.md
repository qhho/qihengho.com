Under Construction. Stay tuned!

<!-- ## Research Interests: Assured Autonomous Systems

My research focuses on designing **Assured Autonomous Systems** that operate safely and reliably with uncertainty, partial observability, and incomplete information. I am broadly interested in the theoretical analysis, designing efficient algorithms and practical techniques for:

- Decision-making under uncertainty (MDPs, POMDPs, Games)
- Motion planning under uncertainty
- Temporally extended tasks (Temporal Logics, Non-Markovian objectives, long horizon sparse reward problems)
- Formal synthesis and verification
- Multi-layered autonomoous system architectures
- Data-driven models for planning
- Applications in robotics and space systems -->

<!-- ### 1. Belief-Space Task and Motion Planning

This area focuses on enabling robots to plan and act in uncertain and partially observable environments under temporal logic specifications by reasoning directly in the space of probability distributions.

### 2. Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs)

My research in POMDPs centers on systematic high-level, sequential decision-making under both dynamic and state uncertainty, particularly for real-world applications with constraints and temporal logic tasks.

### 3. Hybrid and Multi-Layered Systems

This thrust addresses complex scenarios where continuous dynamics and discrete events interact under uncertainty, and aims to provide system-level assurances across multiple layers of autonomy.
* Developed the first probabilistically complete algorithms to synthesize winning reachability strategies in nondeterministic hybrid games, often utilizing bandit-based techniques with sampling-based exploration.
* Introduced information-based "shields" where solutions from a high-level POMDP decision-making module constrain other subsystems, ensuring overall system behavior satisfies desired specifications with minimal information transfer. -->
