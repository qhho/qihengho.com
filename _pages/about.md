# Welcome!

I am a PhD Candidate in Autonomous Systems at the University of Colorado Boulder, advised by Prof. Zachary Sunberg and Prof. Morteza Lahijanian. My goal is to enable safety-critical autonomous partially observable cyber-physical systems under uncertainty to complete complex temporal tasks while providing explicit guarantees on their safety and operational properties. Recently, my focus has been on developing theoretically sound and practically efficient algorithms for decision-making under uncertainty in safety-critical robotics and autonomous systems. This often involves combining techniques from formal methods (temporal logics, hybrid systems), probabilistic modeling and planning (MDPs, POMDPs, Stochastic Games), and reinforcement learning. My research finds applications in diverse areas such as self-driving cars, uncrewed aerial vehicles, space robotic systems, underwater vehicles, smart grids, and operations research.

<h2>Research: Assured Autonomous Systems</h2>

My research focuses on designing **Assured Autonomous Systems** that operate safely and reliably with uncertainty, partial observability, and incomplete information. I am broadly interested in the theoretical analysis, designing efficient algorithms and practical techniques for:

- Decision-making under uncertainty (MDPs, POMDPs, Games)
- Motion planning under uncertainty
- Temporally extended tasks (Temporal Logic specifications, Non-Markovian objectives, long horizon sparse reward problems)
- Formal synthesis and verification
- Multi-layered autonomoous system architectures
- Data-driven models for planning, reinforcement Learning for POMDPs
- Applications in robotics and space systems
